* At least one additional API style was also considered before making the final decision.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Run</summary>

* Since the API is independent of the delivery mechanism, multiple options were implemented, allowing consumers to choose based on their needs.&#x20;
* Reports evaluating the performance and convenience of different API styles were also produced.

</details>
